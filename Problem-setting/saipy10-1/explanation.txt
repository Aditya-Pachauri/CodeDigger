Problem Recap:
You are given an IP address and a subnet mask in the format IP/m.
Your job is to calculate:

The number of subnets that can be created.
The number of usable hosts (devices) per subnet.

Key Concepts:
Subnet Mask: Determines how many bits in the IP address are reserved for identifying the network.

For example, /24 means the first 24 bits are for the network, and the remaining 32−24=8 bits are for identifying devices.
Borrowing Bits: When creating subnets, we borrow bits from the "device portion" of the address. Each borrowed bit doubles the number of subnets but reduces the number of devices per subnet.

Formulas:

Number of Subnets:

Number of Subnets = 2^𝑛
Where 
n = (new subnet mask) - (default subnet mask).

Usable Hosts per Subnet:

Usable Hosts per Subnet=2^h −2
Where 
h = (remaining host bits) = 32−new subnet mask.
