Problem:
Dividing a Network into Subnets

A company uses a network to connect computers and devices. The network is represented by an IP address (a unique identifier for a network) and a subnet mask (a way to divide the network into smaller parts). Your task is to determine two things:

1. How many smaller networks (subnets) can be created from the given network.
2. How many devices (usable hosts) can connect to each smaller network.

Understanding the Basics:
An IP address looks like `192.168.1.0`. Itâ€™s a way to identify devices on a network, like addresses in a city. The subnet mask, written as `/m` (e.g., `/24`), tells you how much of the IP address is reserved for the network and how much is available for devices.

Example:
For the network `192.168.1.0/24`:
- The `/24` means the first 24 bits are reserved for identifying the network. The remaining bits (out of 32) are for identifying devices.

Splitting a Network:
When dividing a network into smaller subnets:
- More subnets mean fewer devices per subnet.
- The number of bits borrowed from the remaining device bits determines how many subnets can be created.

Input:
First line containing number of cases followed by 
A single line containing:
- An IP address and a subnet mask in the format `IP/m`.  
  Example: `192.168.1.0/26`.

Output:
Two integers:
1. The number of subnets created by dividing the network.
2. The number of usable devices (hosts) in each subnet.
Incase of Invalid IP output -1.

Explanation of the Problem:
1. Number of Subnets:
   Each bit borrowed for subnetting doubles the number of subnets. For example:
   - Borrowing 2 bits creates 2^2 = 4  subnets.

2. Number of Usable Hosts:
   The remaining bits after subnetting determine the number of devices per subnet. For example:
   - If 6 bits remain, the total is 2^6 - 2 = 62  usable hosts (subtracting 2 for network and broadcast addresses).


Example 1:

Input:
1
192.168.1.0/26

Output:
4 62

Explanation:
1. The original network is Class C, so the default subnet mask is `/24`.
2. The given subnet mask is `/26`, meaning n = 26 - 24 = 2  bits are borrowed.
   - Number of Subnets: 2^2 = 4 .
3. After borrowing 2 bits, h = 32 - 26 = 6  bits remain for devices.
   - Usable Hosts per Subnet: 2^6 - 2 = 62 .


Example 2:

Input:
1
10.0.0.0/20

Output:
16 4094

Explanation:
1. The original network is Class A, so the default subnet mask is `/8`.
2. The given subnet mask is `/20`, meaning n = 20 - 8 = 12  bits are borrowed.
   - Number of Subnets: 2^{12} = 4096 .
3. After borrowing 12 bits, h = 32 - 20 = 12  bits remain for devices.
   - Usable Hosts per Subnet: 2^{12} - 2 = 4094 .

Note:
This problem can be solved without prior networking knowledge by using the formulas:
1. Number of Subnets: 2^n , where n  is the number of bits borrowed.
2. Usable Hosts per Subnet: 2^h - 2 , where h  is the number of bits left for devices.
