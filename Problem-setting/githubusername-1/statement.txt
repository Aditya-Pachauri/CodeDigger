 Fix the Bulb

There are n bulbs, numbered from 1 to n. The Bulbs are malfunctioning(OFF initially).Initially at 0th second the bulb x is in ON state. Every second, the Bulb k
 which is in ON state turns OFF and the Bulbs, k−1
 (if it exists) and k+1 (if it exists) turns ON.

This process happens for all the Bulbs which are in ON state at the same time. 
Your task is to determine the least second at which maximum number of Bulbs are turned ON.

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤10000)
The one and only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1≤n≤10^18;1≤x≤n)
 — the number of Bulbs and the Bulb which is ON initially.
Output
output a single integer: the least second at which maximum number of Bulbs are turned ON.
