For calculating maxx, we can sort the given string x using a comparator function where the priority is given as F>E>D…>A>9>8>7…>1>0.
To find the minx, we can reverse maxx. If minx contains leading zeros, we can use a for loop to find the position of the first non zero number and swap it with the first position of minx.
To compare the hexadecimal numbers, we can convert them to integers and then compare them.
We need to check for “0” manually as it is the only number having leading zeros.
