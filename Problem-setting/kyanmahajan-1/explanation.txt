The problem can be seen as the problem to find the numbers in an array which are 0, which are greater than 0 and smaller than v, and which are greater than v.
For that make three integers initialised to 0. Try to increase the integers by one when the corresponding number is found. This will traverse the array and take care
of the number of circles, parabola and ellipses.
